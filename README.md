# go-generalized-ml
This repository contains the code for a simulation of small-board (3x3 and 4x4 options) Go, and a generalized learning algorithm that can be trained to play the game against a human player. The learning algorithm used is based on Arthur Samuel's 1959 checkers program, which learned to play its titular game by changing weights attached to predetermined heuristics and strategies associated with checkers. This project was created for submission as the final project for CS 448 (Fall 2018) at Willamette University. This code was created using the Netbeans IDE 8.2 and has been successfully tested as a Netbeans project with JDK 8u181 as of September 2019. The program can be started by running the "Go.java" file as main. It has been tested inside both the Netbeans IDE and Windows command line with the aforementioned JDK 8u181.
